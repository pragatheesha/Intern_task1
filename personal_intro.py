- How to organize files and write documentation for a Python project

# Main program
print("Hello World")

name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
hobby = input("What is your favorite hobby? ")

print(f"\n🎉 Welcome {name}! 🎉")
print(f"You are {age} years old and you love {hobby}.")

name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
hobby = input("What is your favorite hobby? ")
city = input("Which city do you live in? ")

print("\n🎉 Welcome! 🎉")
print(f"Hello {name}! You are {age} years old, living in {city}, and you enjoy {hobby}.")
print("Nice to meet you! 😊")
