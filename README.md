# Personal Introduction Program

## Project overview
A small Python command-line program that asks the user for their name, age, hobby, and city, then prints a friendly welcome message. Intended as a beginner Python project demonstrating `input()`, variables, basic validation, and formatted output.

## Files
- `personal_intro.py` — main program
- `requirements.txt` — dependency list (none required)
- `screenshot.png` — example output screenshot

## Setup & run
1. Install Python (3.7+ recommended) from https://python.org
2. Clone repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>

# Code Structure
- `personal_intro.py` → main program
- `requirements.txt` → dependencies (none required)
- `screenshot.png` → program output screenshot
- `README.md` → project documentation

# What I Learned
- How to use `input()` to collect user information
- How to assign values to variables
